          Stark is initially depicted as an industrialist, genius inventor, and
          former playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. Stark becomes a
          founding member and eventual leader of the Avengers.

        With a net worth of $100 billion, Tony Stark is easily one of the
        richest men in the Marvel Universe, or any universe for that matter. In
        the comics Stark Industries is the leading provider of just about
        everything imaginable in the tech sector. And when he isn’t jetting
        about blasting supervillains as Iron Man, Stark puts his genius-level
        intelligence to work coming up with technological and scientific
        breakthroughs that his company can patent. This means that Stark
        Industries owns enough patents rights to bring in billions of dollars
        regardless of any other business dealings. But Tony Stark isn’t the type
        of guy to just sit back and let his money and ideas work for him. He
        needs to continue pushing the envelope and coming up with cutting edge
        ways to improve his various suits of armor so he can become a more
        powerful hero. He’s also pretty much solely responsible for funding the
        entire Avengers team so anytime they crash a Quinjet he knows it’s
        coming out of his pocket.
